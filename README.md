# Space Invaders

This is the final project of the online course ["How to Code: Simple Data"](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-simple-data-ubcx-htc1x) by Gregor Kiczales (University of British Columbia).

The program is a simple interactive game in which you control a tank at the bottom of the screen and aim to shoot down the "invaders" which appear at random locations and intervals at the top of the screen. The user controls the direction of the tank with the right and left arrow keys, and fires missiles with the spacebar.

The program is run in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/download/). Use the command `main(G0)` to start.

All code my own, aside from what was provided in the base file (which was mostly constant definitions and the base data definitions - no functions). Unfortunately, I did not track changes on GitHub while building the project, which is why the first commit is the completed project.

The core purpose of this project was to practice using fundamentals taught by the course, such as designing data definitions and function definitions from a recipe, designing interactive world programs, programming from unit tests, and working with compound data / self-referrential data.
